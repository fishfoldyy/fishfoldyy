<b>hey! i'm fishfoldyy!</b>

<p>i am a coder for fun. most of my projects are for friends or just purely as entertainment.</p>
<p>most of my projects are found on replit <a href="https://replit.com/@fishfoldyy">here</a>.</p>
<p>i am very proud of figuring out html/css/js! find my personal website at <a href=https://fishfoldyy.github.io/site/>https://fishfoldyy.github.io/site</a>.</p>
<p>ive also done python discord bots and basic javascript things. im not a good coder, but it's probably enough to blow some friend's minds :D</p>
<p>if you need help (im not likely to help much in fact) contact me via <a href="discord.com/channels/@me/991277703258964060">discord</a>. </p>
